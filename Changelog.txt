=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

(none)

=== Version/Release 2.10.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2023.08.18; Maikuolan]: Improved tests and documentation for the operation
  handler.

- [2023.08.28; Maikuolan]: The operation handler can now serve method calls.
  Added guard to the events orchestrator to prevent infinite looping via
  recursive event firing from within handlers.

- [2023.09.14; Maikuolan]: Moved the version constant and the dataTraverse
  method to an abstract class, which the other classes can then extend from,
  due to those being common to all/most classes in the package. Added support
  for dot notation to the L10N handler.

=== Version/Release 2.9.7 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2023.05.13; Maikuolan]: Fixed a link.

- [2023.08.16; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Typo in the code for handling "then"
  statements in the operation handler's ifCompare method; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 2.9.6 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2023.02.24; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The cache handler's incEntry and decEntry
  methods weren't handling non-expiring values correctly when using flatfile
  caching; Fixed.

- [2023.03.15; Maikuolan]: The operation handler's dataTraverse method can now
  traverse object properties.

- [2023.03.16; Maikuolan]: Support for more operators added to the operation
  handler's ifCompare method. Added a new parameter to the operation handler's
  dataTraverse method to enable implementations to specify whether it should
  allow or prohibit non-scalar return values.

- [2023.03.18; Maikuolan]: The YAML handler's dataTraverse method synchronised
  with the operation handler's dataTraverse method to be the same, to be able
  to likewise have it specified whether to allow or prohibit non-scalar return
  values and etc (might consider utilising class extensibility in a future
  major version to reduce code duplication, but as doing that would mean that
  classes wouldn't be able to be implemented in isolation anymore, I would
  consider it backwards-incompatible change, so it won't happen any time sooner
  than the next major version, at least).

- [2023.03.22; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The YAML handler wasn't correctly dealing
  with sequences which terminate with folded scalars; Fixed.

- [2023.03.24; Maikuolan]: Added a new property to the request handler to act
  as an object-level logger for the results of outbound requests.

=== Version/Release 2.9.5 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2023.01.28; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Cache handler potentially generating
  unexpected exceptions in some situations; Fixed.

- [2023.02.13; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved performance for when using PDO.

- [2023.02.21; Maikuolan]: When using the cache handler with PDO, if the size
  of a cache entry exceeds 64KB, in order to avoid exceeding the 64KB upper
  limit of the TEXT data type, the cache handler will now attempt to compress
  the data prior to executing the query.

- [2023.02.23; Maikuolan]: Optionally, the L10N handler can now automatically
  determine text directionality for use by the implementation.

=== Version/Release 2.9.4 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2022.12.15; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Redis shouldn't set EXPIRE for TTLs less
  than 1; Fixed.

- [2023.01.14; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The code for fetching all entries from the
  cache when using Memcached as the chosen caching mechanism relied on
  Memcached methods which haven't worked properly since several major versions
  back from the current latest Memcached bindings. Accordingly, the cache
  handler wasn't capable of correctly fetching all entries when using
  Memcached. To remedy this, the code which relied upon said methods has been
  removed, and in its place, code has been added to manually index cache keys,
  and when fetching all entries from the cache, this manual indexing will now
  be relied upon when using Memcached (the code for other caching mechanisms,
  unaffected by this problem, remains unchanged).

- [2023.01.16; Maikuolan]: Added a new method to the cache handler:
  "getAllEntriesWhere" (see the documentation for more details).

- [2023.01.22; Maikuolan]: Improved the defaulting used for missing plurals.

=== Version/Release 2.9.3 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2022.10.26; Maikuolan]: The YAML handler can now handle objects when
  reconstructing YAML data, as long as those objects implement the __toString
  method.

- [2022.11.20; Maikuolan]: Avoid packaging unnecessary files into dist.

- [2022.11.22; Maikuolan]: Some of the CLDR information provided by Unicode
  recently changed. Updated the L10N handler accordingly.

Caleb M (Maikuolan),
November 22, 2022.

=== Version/Release 2.9.2 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2022.10.05; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Fix prevents YAML handler from using
  multiline when reconstructing values containing hashes, because multiline
  values are normally unquoted and unescaped, thus meaning that data which
  occurs after the hash would be treated as a comment when reprocessed.

Caleb M (Maikuolan),
October 5, 2022.

=== Version/Release 2.9.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2022.06.09; Maikuolan]: Added three new methods to the cache handler:
  "deleteAllEntriesWhere", "incEntry", and "decEntry" (see the documentation
  for more details).

- [2022.06.16; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The KeyRoot parameter in the
  iterateCallbackGeneratorInner method of the Matrix handler should not be
  optional; Fixed.

- [2022.06.19; Maikuolan]: Updated the delayed file IO class to use a faster
  strategy for reading files when not locking those files. Added to the L10N
  handler's supported languages.

- [2022.07.07; Maikuolan]: Added Kaktovik support to the number formatter.

- [2022.07.13; Maikuolan]: Added the optional ability for the cache handler to
  attempt to enforce the permissions necessary for reading and writing files.

Caleb M (Maikuolan),
July 13, 2022.

=== Version/Release 2.9.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2022.02.19; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to the YAML handler to reconstruct
  flows at specified depths and to switch between JSON-style and YAML-style
  mappings/sequences based on depth. Added the ability to apply quotes to keys
  for the YAML handler.

- [2022.02.20; Maikuolan]: Added a new class to the repository, "IPHeader".

- [2022.02.21; Maikuolan]: Added tests and documentation for the IP header
  class.

=== Version/Release 2.8.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2022.01.23; Maikuolan]: Provided a means to avoid some theoretical
  problems with data reconstruction by the YAML handler.

- [2022.01.28; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to reconstruct anchors to the YAML
  handler. Added guards against invalid data types for keys to the YAML
  handler.

- [2022.01.29; Maikuolan]: Added UTF-16 and UTF-32 support to the YAML handler.
  Added the optional ability to perform spec-compliant (un/)escaping.

- [2022.01.31; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Fixed a small typo in one of the
  Demojibakefier's regular expressions.

- [2022.01.31; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to specify the preferred style of
  quotes for strings for the YAML handler. Added support for hexadecimal,
  binary, and octal number notation.

  plural rules documentation. Added Ol Chiki support to the number formatter.
  Added the ability to the L10N handler to automatically determine appropriate
  integer and fraction rules to use based upon a language code specified.

- [2022.02.05; Maikuolan]: Added support for null sets (mapping keys) and some
  basic, rudimentary support for explicit tags and and related type coercion to
  the YAML handler. Support for explicit tags currently only works on
  individual entries, not entire blocks (I aim to implement the latter soon).

- [2022.02.06; Maikuolan]: Added support for binary tags. Explicit tags can now
  be used for both individual entries and entire blocks alike. Added support
  for flow mapping to the YAML handler.

- [2022.02.07; Maikuolan]: Added support for merging to the YAML handler.

- [2022.02.11; Maikuolan]: Removed newline guard from the YAML handler (YAML is
  allowed to exist on a single line, e.g., by using entirely inline syntax).
  Implemented a flow control mechanism to the YAML handler, improving support
  for flow sequences and flow mappings. Added support for flattening arrays.

- [2022.02.12; Maikuolan]: Added support for calling a limited range of various
  safe PHP functions as tags to the YAML handler.

- [2022.02.13; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to assign language rules
  automatically to the L10N handler.

- [2022.02.14; Maikuolan]: Added support for chomping to the YAML handler.

=== Version/Release 2.7.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2021.08.25; Maikuolan]: Inline variables (similar to as is done with
  Ansible) can now be used in data for the YAML handler.

- [2021.09.18; Maikuolan]: The YAML handler now supports inline arrays.

- [2021.10.30; Maikuolan]: Code-style cleanup: Public before private
  properties, magic before public before private methods.

- [2021.10.31; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to segregate cache data on the
  basis of prefixes specified by the instance.

Caleb M (Maikuolan),
October 31, 2021.

=== Version/Release 2.6.2 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2021.07.02; Maikuolan]: Allow dots to be escaped for dataTraverse in the
  operation handler.

=== Version/Release 2.6.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2021.05.21; Maikuolan]: Adjusted the ints returned by L10N's int3Type3 so
  they'd make more sense. Added some more languages to L10N's rules
  documentation.

- [2021.05.22; Maikuolan]: Added a public version constant to all classes,
  since it might be needed by some implementations to ensure compatibility.
  Improved and refactored some of the docblock comments across all classes.
  Added an exception to the Matrix handler for when the number of dimensions
  given to iterateCallback doesn't match the Matrix's number of dimensions.
  Added tests for the matrix handler, the delayed file IO, the events
  orchestrator, and the request handler classes.
