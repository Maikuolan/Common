=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2022.06.09; Maikuolan]: Added three new methods to the cache handler:
  "deleteAllEntriesWhere", "incEntry", and "decEntry" (see the documentation
  for more details).

- [2022.06.19; Maikuolan]: Have the delayed file IO class use a faster strategy
  for reading files when not locking those files.

=== Version/Release 1.9.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2022.02.19; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to the YAML handler to reconstruct
  flows at specified depths and to switch between JSON-style and YAML-style
  mappings/sequences based on depth. Added the ability to apply quotes to keys
  for the YAML handler.

- [2022.02.20; Maikuolan]: Added a new class to the repository, "IPHeader".

  class.

=== Version/Release 1.8.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2022.01.23; Maikuolan]: Provided a means to avoid some theoretical
  problems with data reconstruction by the YAML handler.

- [2022.01.28; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to reconstruct anchors to the YAML
  handler. Added guards against invalid data types for keys to the YAML
  handler.

- [2022.01.29; Maikuolan]: Added UTF-16 and UTF-32 support to the YAML handler.
  Added the optional ability to perform spec-compliant (un/)escaping.

- [2022.01.31; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Fixed a small typo in one of the
  Demojibakefier's regular expressions.

- [2022.01.31; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to specify the preferred style of
  quotes for strings for the YAML handler. Added support for hexadecimal,
  binary, and octal number notation.

- [2022.02.02; Maikuolan]: Updated the L10N handler's supported languages and
  plural rules documentation. Added Ol Chiki support to the number formatter.
  Added the ability to the L10N handler to automatically determine appropriate
  integer and fraction rules to use based upon a language code specified.

- [2022.02.05; Maikuolan]: Added support for null sets (mapping keys) and some
  basic, rudimentary support for explicit tags and and related type coercion to
  the YAML handler. Support for explicit tags currently only works on
  individual entries, not entire blocks (I aim to implement the latter soon).

- [2022.02.06; Maikuolan]: Added support for binary tags. Explicit tags can now
  be used for both individual entries and entire blocks alike. Added support
  for flow mapping to the YAML handler.

- [2022.02.07; Maikuolan]: Added support for merging to the YAML handler.

- [2022.02.11; Maikuolan]: Removed newline guard from the YAML handler (YAML is
  allowed to exist on a single line, e.g., by using entirely inline syntax).
  Implemented a flow control mechanism to the YAML handler, improving support
  for flow sequences and flow mappings. Added support for flattening arrays.

- [2022.02.12; Maikuolan]: Added support for calling a limited range of various
  safe PHP functions as tags to the YAML handler.

- [2022.02.13; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to assign language rules
  automatically to the L10N handler.

- [2022.02.14; Maikuolan]: Added support for chomping to the YAML handler.
  Added support for infinity, negative infinity, and NAN to the YAML handler.

  Ansible) can now be used in data for the YAML handler.

- [2021.09.18; Maikuolan]: The YAML handler now supports inline arrays.

- [2021.10.30; Maikuolan]: Code-style cleanup: Public before private
  properties, magic before public before private methods.

- [2021.10.31; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to segregate cache data on the
  basis of prefixes specified by the instance.

  calling the recompile() method.

- [2019.12.26; Maikuolan]: Added some new character sets and related options to
  the number formatter.

- [2019.12.27; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: The cache handler's mechanism for creating
