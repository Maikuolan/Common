### Documentation for the "YAML" class.

*Used by CIDRAM and phpMussel to handle YAML data, the YAML class is a simple YAML handler intended to adequately serve the needs of the packages and projects where it is implemented. Note however, that isn't a complete YAML solution, instead supporting the YAML specification only to the bare minimum required by those packages and projects known to implement it, and I therefore can't guarantee that it'll necessarily be an ideal solution for other packages and projects, whose exact requirements I mightn't be familiar with.*
