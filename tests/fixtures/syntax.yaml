 Deep outer:
  Deep inner:
   Deep innermost: "Thus, from here, within this variable, a value is inserted"
String foo: "Bar"
Integer foo: 1234
Float foo: 123.4
Example implicit numeric array:

 - "Bar1"
 2: "Bar2"
 3: "Bar3"
 xFooX: "xBarX"
 Some int: 4567

 This is false: false
 This is also false: -
 This is null: null

Testing anchors:
 Anchored text push: &TestAnchor "Some placeholder text."
 Anchored text pull: *TestAnchor
Escaping test: "Our number is \#123-456-789."
Inserts test: "Hello world; {{Deep outermost.Deep outer.Deep inner.Deep innermost}}; It should work, hopefully."
Inline array example: [this, is, a, test., "Foo", "Bar", true, false, 123]
